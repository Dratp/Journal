okay I know this is the morning on 12/5 that I am typing this.

on Thursday 12/3 I had my first good day at work since starting my new career.
Turns out just feeling useful is an amazing thing.

Amber has refused to video chat for 3 days now.
The first time she said there was an emergency.
also becuase of the emergency she did not come and watch the kids thursday
This made my thursday even more amazing as I took care of the 3 kids on my own and was useful at my new carreer .
Please note it was just a really small task but made me feel good.  I am just limited scheduling options for christmas eve and new years eve
for the rocket mortgage website

Amber thursday ight did not even respond to my message to video chat I GPSed her turned out the emergency was going to her friends house.
Justice had her tire fall off her van.  Not that amber could help her but emotional support I guess
now for thursday night and friday night she did not want to video chat.
She said she was mad I GPSed her and says she is punishing me by doing this.  This is not about me it is about the kids.

I told her per her text for now on I would not go out of my way to make sure she talks with her boys anymore.
She obviouslty doesn't want to and the onus should not be on me to force her to do so.

Well with work going better I am feeling pretty good.
Me and the boys are all having some lose poops so I think I need to work on our diet.
Lastly the boys are super happy and James is excited every day for the lego advent calendar.

we built the boat day 1
a police guy day 2
a police station day 3
a yellow truck day 4 
and day 5 this morning a guy with TNT

Cecil is amazing such full sentences and communicates so well.
Davey is starting to have tamptrums every so often now.

Have a great day
