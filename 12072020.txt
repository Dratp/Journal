James was up at 5am watching TV so I brought him into bed and talked about needing to get enough sleep.  
He fell back asleep for a few hours and it just woke up.

We built the 7th day on the advent calendar and it was a little helocopter.
over the weekend it was really busy 
Saturday we put up the tree and visted aunt cheese to getting baths.
Sunday Aunt Katie helped me clean out Amber's amd decorate the tree and stayed with the boys so I could go grocery shopping

I spent a lot of money on chritmas gifts for the kids.
Got a trampoline to replace the one that broe in the basement
Got a beyblade stadium for James
also got ball table for Davey.  I am so excited to have so much christmas shopping done and they are going to be so excited.

Also I was worried about another stimulus check happening before Christmas becuase if it did everyone would slpurge on cirstmas gifts and it could create a shortage

Today Amber is taking Davey to the Dr for his 18 month checkup
She could not promie to be here with the kids so I have my Dad on standby, we will see how this goes.

Amber did not contact me any yesterday expect at around 9pm to ask me to bathe Davey for his dr apt.
At 9pm it would be too late to bathe him but she is living in her carefree world so I don't think she thinks about these things
anyways I told her that Davey had a bath on saturday and is good to go.

Have a great day!
I know I will... 
We are no longer surviving we are conquering this challenge.
Also James told me he wants Mini muffins for breakfast.. so time to get baking for me.

James just saw the word to above and told me it was one of his sight words
he is sitting next to me as I type
