I figured doing this daily helps to highlight the actual day.
Today We put up the christmas tree and we also saw aunt cheese and grandpa heizer

Amber said she will be here monday to take Davey to the dr but can't promise she will be here all day so I have my dad comming over to help as well.
due to the discussion we had via text message about her video chatting with the kids
Today she made no attempt at all to video chat.  

The boys had a lot of fun playing in the tub and cecil and james are super excited to decorate the christmas tree tomorrow

Tomorrow is a big day.
Aunt Katie is comming over and I am going to start packing up amber's stuff from the bedroom.
It has been a few months since she has stayed here and so I believe it is time to begin packing it up.

My Dad is worried regarding me waiting to file for divorce until next year.
but that is when I will have the funds to start the filling.

Also to be honest as a man going through divorce I am scared as to what the court will see me as
I know I am doing all the right things as I am not abandoning my children like amber is but at the same time there is just such a stigma
Not sure if I wrote this or not but I am no longer mentioning to the biys about video chatting with thier mom as it has been 4 days since the last video chat now
getting thier hopes up for that 15 mins with thier mom every night for it not to happen hurts them and as much as I want Amber in thier lives I can't let them be let down over and over
A huge thank you to Uncle Ben, Aunt Alicia, Aunt Cheese for filling in to video chat for amber the past nights.

Well that was pretty much my day.
Here is to tomorrow it will be a busy day

P.S.
My Dad says Cecil is just like me at his age climbing nd getting things and exploring
